# White Label App - Brand Manager

Forked from [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate).

Manage easily your white label brands with this Electron React app. Load your "brands" folder inside the project directory and see your local brands. Edit them, add new ones, delete them, etc.
